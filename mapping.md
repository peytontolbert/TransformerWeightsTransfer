### E. Output Layer

- **Purpose:** Map the processed data to output classes or predictions.
- **Models Implementing:** Final linear or projection layers are present in all models.

## 6. Unified Mapping Strategy

To align the diverse architectures, the following strategies are proposed:

### A. Shared Latent Space

- **Objective:** Encourage models to represent inputs within a common latent space despite architectural differences.
- **Approach:** Utilize shared embedding layers or align internal representations through specialized loss functions.

### B. Cross-Model Consistency Losses

- **Objective:** Align the outputs or intermediate representations across different models.
- **Approach:** Introduce additional loss terms that penalize discrepancies between models' outputs or features.

### C. Weight Sharing

- **Objective:** Promote similar representations by sharing certain layers or parameters across models where feasible.
- **Approach:** Identify and share compatible layers or parameters between models with similar functionalities.

## 7. Implementation Considerations

### A. Aligning Intermediate Representations

- Extract and compare features from corresponding layers in each model to ensure consistency in representations.

### B. Projection Layers for Architectural Differences

- Implement projection layers to map features from differing architectures into a common space, facilitating effective alignment.

### C. Balancing Loss Weights

- Carefully balance primary task loss with consistency losses to ensure that alignment does not hinder model performance.

## 8. Potential Challenges

- **Architectural Differences:** Varying internal structures may complicate direct feature comparisons.
  - *Solution:* Use projection layers to map features to a shared space before computing consistency losses.
  
- **Computational Overhead:** Introducing additional loss terms can increase computational demands.
  - *Solution:* Optimize training loops and selectively apply consistency losses to essential layers.

## 9. Next Steps

1. **Implement Feature Alignment:** Modify all models to expose intermediate features required for consistency losses.
2. **Adjust Training Processes:** Incorporate cross-model consistency losses into the training loops of all models.
3. **Experiment with Loss Weights:** Determine optimal weights for primary and consistency losses to balance alignment with performance.
4. **Monitor and Evaluate:** Continuously assess the impact of mappings on model convergence and overall performance.

## 10. Additional Resources
