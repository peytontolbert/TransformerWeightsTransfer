LSSM from LLaMA
Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a Linear State Space Model (LSSM) by transferring weights from a pretrained LLaMA model. The LSSM is a simplified linear approximation of the LLaMA model's MLP layer, designed to process input text and compare its outputs with those of the original LLaMA model.
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
torch: PyTorch library for tensor computations and neural networks.
transformers: Hugging Face's Transformers library for accessing pretrained models and tokenizers.

You can install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install torch transformers
```


Usage
To execute the main script and see the LSSM in action, run the following command:
```
python main.py
```

This will load a pretrained LLaMA model, create an LSSM from its weights, process a sample input text, and compare the outputs of the LSSM with the original LLaMA model.

Notes
The LSSM is a linear approximation and may not fully capture the non-linearities of the original LLaMA model.
Ensure you have access to the pretrained LLaMA model specified in the main.py script.
